	    <h1>About Spencer</h1>
		
		<p><strong>Welcome!</strong> My name is Spencer Hoyt and currently I am a freshman at URI majoring in Computer Science and hopefully minoring in Cybersecurity. <br>
		I am unfortunetly not on campus this year, however I am commuting so I will at least be on campus a little bit. I have not had much coding experience, and this is my <br>
		first time actaully coding stuff that is going on to a live website, which is pretty exciting for me, despite it not being a very hard thing to do. Anyway, I am <br> 
		18 years old and have had a number of odd jobs here and there, including working at a Chick-fil-A restaurant, which was an extremely fun and rewarding job, <br>
		especially for the food! Right now I am a lifeguard working for a private pool club, as well as a sales representative at my local Home Depot. I have been <br>
		swimming (as a sport) my entire life, with a little bit of cross country/track here and there. I absolutely love meeting new people, so if you want my phone <br>
		number is 860-338-6358. My snapchat is @hoytspencer and my instagram is @spencerhoyt. Feel free to add me and get in touch however you want! I look forward to <br>
		meeting you!
